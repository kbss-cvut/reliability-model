Basic data of quality staff

	What does quality staff means? I can interpret it in two wasys:
		- meaning 1 - staff that is concerned with the quality of the product
		- meaning 2 - the quality of the staff it self, e.g. 
		
	I assume that the AVIC presentations refers to "meaning 1".

	
	The presentation slide is concerned to show a statistical report about the qualification of quality-staff. I split the schema into a generic schema and a profile schema which defines specific staff quality measures.
	
	Regarding measures. 
		The conceptual schema has some problems. One such problem commonly used classes such as "senior engineer" can be also used measures, e.g. an employee is more valuable if it is a "senior engineer". This is not modeled in the draft domain ontology.
	
	Term normalization
		Term disambiguation
			personnel, staff, employees, engineers 
				- I think these terms refer to the same concept. In the model I use the term "staff" in place of personnel.
				- additionally I use staff instead of employees and engineer-staff instead of engineers
		Adding terms not in the diagram
			Introducing new terms by breaking the phrases into smaller ones, by generalization [list is not complete]
				classes
				- person
				- senior-engineer
				- engineer
				- certified-employee
				- employee
				- certificate
				- degree
				- masters-degree
			
				object properties
				- has certificate
				- higher
