Fault symptom:
On December 18, 2019,  short circuit failure of 380V internal power supply occurred in No. 1234 excavator controller during debugging, resulting in serious burning of the product’s interior and damage to its shell.  The interior was found to be severely burned after disassembly of the product. Heavily damaged elements are as follows: 380 V power wire, 380 V ground wire, 380 V printed board 1, printed board 2, 380 V filter capacitor. The 380 V power wire, 380 V ground wire, the motor’s phase A power wire and the power pins mounted on printed board 2 were burned out. Printed boards 1 and 2 were largely burned black. 

Failure cause:
A preliminary analysis suggests that the excavator controller was burned out primarily because of the 380V power-to-ground short caused by the short circuit in the inverter’s ABCD power tube.  As the power supply’s current limit is too high,  the 380V power was not  cut off immediately after the short circuit occurred and thus wire and power tube become the only short circuit load. The high current then led to a sharp increase in wire temperature, causing the plastic coating on the wire to melt. Since high power connectors were installed on the cover plate, the wire inside the product was relatively long. The wire was attached to the internal shell due to tension. Therefore, once the plastic coating  melted, the copper wire inside was exposed to the shell, resulting in discharge and sparking. This would later burn and break the shell.
