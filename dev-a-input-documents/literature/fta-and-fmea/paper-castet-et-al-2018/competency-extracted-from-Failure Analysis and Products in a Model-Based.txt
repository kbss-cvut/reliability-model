model for FMECA methodology 
usecase summary - 
    The FMECA is a reliability design analysis technique used
    to analyze systematically postulated failures in components
    of the system to determine the resultant effects. It is
    performed primarily to identify potential design deficiencies
    and single-point failures (SPFs), so that appropriate risk management steps may be undertaken for the flight design
    and mission operations (e.g., preventive measures to
    decrease the likelihood of occurrence of the failure,
    mitigation actions to lessen the consequences of a failure
    when present in the system).

key concepts
    reliability - this concept is subject to the methodology and it is not being used directly. Rather the methodology model describes systems, their behavior and its potential failures.

Functional FMECAs are performed down to the functional
level to evaluate the impact that lower-level failures have on
system operation. Functional FMECAs can be done
at different levels of the design hierarchy, where the scope
of the FMECAs can be the entire system, or specific subsystems or assemblies.

Piece-part FMECAs are
performed at interfaces to ensure that irreversible physical
and/or functional damage does not propagate across Fault
Containment Region boundaries. For support equipment,
FMEAs are performed at the piece-part level on interfaces
to verify that support equipment failures cannot propagate
or cause damage to flight hardware.

The FTA is a top-down reliability design analysis technique
to deduce faults (i.e., failure causes) systematically and to
assess coverage of risk-reduction steps for those failure
causes. It covers a broad scope of threats beyond hardware
failures, such as environmental effects or operator errors.
Contrary to the FMECA, it assesses the impact of
combinations of threats, including common-cause failures

    failure propagation is captured in the
    model using CauseExplanations. As indicated in [1], 
    CauseExplanations indicate a causal relationship 
    between behaviors: for example, if a
    CauseExplanation analyzes Behavior 2 (B2) and
    explains Behavior 1 (B1), it means that B1 is the
    cause of B2, or conversely, B2 is the effect of B1.

            then
                B1 is the cause of B2 and
                B2 is the effect of B1
                
    The end effect of a failure mode is determined through causal relationships using CauseExplanations.
    Given that FMECAs can be performed at different levels (e.g., system, subsystem), it was decided to leave 
    the determination of the level to the user. if there is a chain of CauseExplanations
    that reaches the top component, then the behavior of the top component or its ViolationExplanation if
    applicable will be reported in the “end effects” column.
    Example
        For example, the user can select the Rover as
        the scope of the FMECA: in that case, given that a
        broken lamp results in the inability for the Rover to
        perform some science activities, that effect will be
        listed in the row related to the broken lamp. 
    Note
        Note that in this example, the fact that there is a single
        level “hop” between the local and the end effect is
        coincidental; many levels can exist in general.

    Likelihood: the likelihood of a failure mode is
    captured in the model using a Likelihood block that
    characterizes the ViolationExplanation of interest.
    Different standards and approaches are possible for
    rating the likelihood. At JPL, we use a 1-3 rating to
    indicate a low, medium, or high probability.

    Severity/Mission Impact: as for the likelihood, the
    severity of the failure mode is modeled using a
    MissionImpact block that characterizes the ViolationExplanation. 
    Example
        JPL uses a 1-6
        rating scheme, where 1 is a minor impact on the
        mission and 6 is a catastrophic failure. If no rating
        is provided, the tool will try to infer a rating, by
        making use of the redundancy information captured using the RedundancyExplanation concept.

    The Fault Tree Analysis starts with determining the scope of
    the analysis. To that effect, the analyst is presented with a
    list of all ViolationExplanations in the system (organized by
    components). The analyst then selects the ViolationExplanation 
    that will constitute the top of the tree. [From there, the
    tool will explore systematically the fault propagation paths
    in the model by identifying CauseExplanations and parsing
    the logical statements they may hold. The immediate causes
    of an event are determined through various means, as
    described in the next few paragraphs. ## this part is broken down further] 
    Example
        The simplest case occurs when “simple” CauseExplanations
        are present, that is, CauseExplanations with single analyzes
        and explains relationships. For example, as illustrated in
        Figure 3, three CauseExplanations analyze the same
        behavior (B1), and each explains a single behavior (B2, B3,
        and B4). In that particular case, the fault tree will interpret
        this model as an OR gate with three immediate causes of the
        event of interest. If the behaviors are explained by
        ViolationExplanations, the ViolationExplanations are
        reported in the tree instead of the behaviors themselves.
        
        Competency questions:

                behavior is associated with system   # behavior is associated with  unique component
                ViolationExplanation explains behavior #

                1) Select system,component
                    What are the systems, subsystems and components in the model?
                2) Select ViolationExplanation(failure mode) of the selected System
                    behavior is associated with [system] # substitute unique component for [system]
                    ViolationExplanation explains behavior
        
        
    
    
        
    Problems
    the effects reported in the “local effects” column must be related to a single ViolationExplanation. If several
    ViolationExplanations need to be combined to obtain that effect (e.g., through an AND logical
    statement in a CauseExplanation in the fault propagation path), then that effect will not be listed.
        How is it possible in our ontology to distinguish that we need two or more necessary conditions?
        How to distinguish that and do not include them in an FMECA (FMEA) table artifact?
        Solution
            1. The model will be based on a set of atomic failures. Composite failures will be composed of the atomic ones. FMECA tables will list only effects can be caused by a single atomic failure/fault. 
            2. It is possible that the model might have different levels of detail/granularity. To use the ontology in such usecase it will require to distinguish weather a failure is atomic or composite cause in the given level of abstraction/detail/granularity.
