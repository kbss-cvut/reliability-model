For example, 45 -21-XX would identify all air conditioning monitoring and testing provided by the Central Maintenance System, and would provide directions for using the Central Maintenance System to execute those maintenance functions. Detailed testing not capable of coverage in Chapter 45 would be appropriately cross referenced and would be provided in Chapter 21. Similarly, 45 -32-XX would identify landing gear monitoring and testing provided by the Central Maintenance System. 45 -45 -XX would identify the Central Maintenance System itself." .
